# impfterminspection

This is the frontend for the [Impfterminspector](https://impfterminspector.de/) site. Data is [fetched](https://github.com/notjosh/impfterminspector) and [aggregated](https://github.com/notjosh/impfterminator) separately. There's a lot of duct tape involved.

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```
