# impfterminspection

This is the frontend for the [Impfterminspector](https://impfterminspector.de/) site. Data is [fetched](https://github.com/notjosh/impfterminspector) and [aggregated](https://github.com/notjosh/impfterminator) separately. There's a lot of duct tape involved.

## Contributing

I'd love some more help on this! I'm not a statistics expect, so if there's a better way to visualise this data, let me know! If you know additional data sources to add in, also let me know.

## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct, and available [here](https://github.com/notjosh/impfterminspection/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Let's be kind to each other. <3

## Good to Know

The site is TypeScript, with Preact. To start the dev server, you'll want:

```
yarn dev
```

And to build the deployable artefacts, you'll want:

```
yarn build
```
